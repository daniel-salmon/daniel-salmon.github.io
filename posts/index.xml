      <description>this spring i came across introduction to graph theory by richard j. trudeau, a wonderful little book on the basics of graph theory. honestly, if i were to suggest a few books to younger me, this would definitely be on that list. the prerequisites are none, yet trudeau is able to build up quite a bit of the beautiful structure of graphs, touching on planarity, euler&amp;rsquo;s formula, colorings and more. admittedly, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t serve as a sole reference on the subject, but it does serve its intended purpose as an introduction.</description>
