      <description>this spring i came across introduction to graph theory by richard j. trudeau, a wonderful little book on the basics of graph theory. honestly, if i were to suggest a few books to younger me, this would definitely be on that list. the prerequisites are none, yet trudeau is able to build up quite a bit of the beautiful structure of graphs, touching on planarity, euler&amp;rsquo;s formula, colorings and more. admittedly, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t serve as a sole reference on the subject, but it does serve its intended purpose as an introduction.</description>

      <description>someday i&amp;rsquo;ll fill this out more thoroughly, but shooting from the hip some of the topics i&amp;rsquo;m most interested in / working on these days:
 distributed systems cryptography the relation of the above two with game theory databases  side interests:
 coffee quantum mechanics / quantum field theory transcendental numbers hacking on whatever is holding my attention that day brazilian jiu-jitsu  although with the pandemic i&amp;rsquo;ve just been riding my bike    things i&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure i&amp;rsquo;m not interested in:</description>

      <description>i&amp;rsquo;m daniel, a phd student in electrical and computer engineering at the university of pittsburgh. that sounds a bit more hands on than my work actually is, and my research interests are pretty broad, although computation&amp;mdash;broadly defined&amp;mdash;is kind of the central theme. check out interests for more.
i&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to work with some pretty talented people, and a quick summary of where i&amp;rsquo;ve been in the past:
